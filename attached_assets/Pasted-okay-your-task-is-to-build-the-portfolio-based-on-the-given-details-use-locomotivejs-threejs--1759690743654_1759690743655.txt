About Me My journey into the world of technology began with a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++. That moment sparked a curiosity that has driven me ever since. I am a recent graduate with a B.Tech in Computer Science from the University Institute of Technology, RGPV, Bhopal.
Throughout my degree, I've developed a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming. I enjoy diving deep into how things work, which led me to focus on backend development. During my internship at Growthify Solutions, I had the opportunity to build and deploy RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, which solidified my interest in creating robust server-side applications.

I am a dedicated problem-solver, consistently practicing on platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef. I'm now eager to apply my skills and passion to a challenging full-time role as a Software Development Engineer, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to learn from experienced professionals.

Skills Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL
Backend: Spring Boot, Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs

Experience Software Development Intern | Growthify Solutions (Remote) (June 2024 - August 2024)
Developed and implemented RESTful APIs using Java and Spring Boot for the new 'User Profile' module, serving over 10,000 users.

Collaborated with the frontend team to integrate APIs, ensuring seamless data flow and improving data retrieval times by 15%.

Wrote unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito, which increased the code coverage of the module to 90% and reduced pre-deployment bugs.

Participated in Agile development cycles, daily stand-up meetings, and code reviews, contributing to a collaborative team environment.
